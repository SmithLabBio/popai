These data were simulated under a model with gene flow between A and B, while A and B are sister.

They were simulated using the code in generate_data.py on May 24, 2024

Note: We include two input types here:
1. vcf formatted input (populations_vcf.txt and alignments/alignment.vcf)
2. alignment formatted input (populations.txt and .fa files in alignments/)

The user will never need to provide both. We have only included both to demonstrate the types of input that delimitpy can parse.
